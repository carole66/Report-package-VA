"Physical risk drivers are changes in both weather and climate. They are expected to increase over a longer time horizon if the transition to a sustainable, net-zero economy is not successful (e.g. the hot-house world which is a high-emission scenario).

The methodology covers eight acute and chronic natural hazard types: fluvial flood, coastal flood, wildfires, drought, extreme heat, tropical cyclone, water stress, extreme cold."
"The starting point of the physical risk assessment is the climate hazard exposure to a counterparty’s geographical location or, when available, its collateral. The exposure is marked as sensitive to acute or chronic risk if the location is sensitive to one of the underlying hazards, as in Moody’s ESG Solutions methodology."
"The Sustainability Department and the Accounting Department ensured the overall consistency of the assessment and proposed a materiality threshold, which was reviewed by the members of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. This analysis was presented to the Audit and Risk Committee and to CNP"

"The thresholds for the materiality analysis are determined individually by risk type. For credit risk, the effect of transition risk is derived from the probability of default of customers in different transition scenarios compared to actual values. For physical risk, the threshold is set individually for each possible event (e.g. flood, wildfire), and the final effect represents a combination of the event's probability and the resilience of a region."

The materiality threshold was set at 3 minimum on a five-point scale, including a materiality threshold corridor of... Furthermore, the preliminary results of the assessment were discussed in structured validation interviews with seven senior validation managers concentrating on topics positioned in the materiality threshold corridor."
"To this end, specific analyses and monitoring of exposures are carried out to assess the materiality of the risk factors identified, maintaining a close connection with the qualitative assessments adopted: by the Bank at sector and sub-sector level (e.g. ESG Sectoral Assessment) for credit risk purposes; for the valuation of government securities for market risk purposes."

"Value at risk"
"Value at Risk (VaR) is a probability-based metric that expresses the maximum potential loss of portfolio value that could be incurred within a specific time horizon, at a pre-defined confidence level. VaR is also used to consolidate exposure to financial risks of the various Group companies which perform banking book activities, also taking into account the benefits of diversification and the correlation between various risk factors and different currencies."
"Wildfires"
"wildfires, heat stress, water stress, hurricanes and typhoons and sea level rise from Moody's"
"With regard to credit risk , the qualitative component of the models currently validated and used by the Group considers various ESG and Climate-related aspects and elements. For Large Corporates, a specific module has also been incorporated into the model that considers quantitative ESG data provided by external providers, and for the Corporate model (companies or groups with a size of less than 500 million euro), an ad hoc module has been developed – in addition to the qualitative questions that also consider socio-environmental risks, to take account of the counterparty’s exposure to physical risks arising from catastrophic events (e.g. damage to production facilities and/or warehouses) – that statistically identifies potential deteriorations in the Probability of Default, using historic and public information on catastrophic events observed at geographic area level."
"with regard to the broader category and the transmission channels of environmental risks, where the main sources of risk for Intesa Sanpaolo’s counterparties and, consequently, for the Group arise from: impacts on nature: changes in the state (quality and quantity) of natural capital caused by an organisation’s activities that may result in changes in nature’s ability to provide social and economic functions. Impacts can be positive or negative"
"Within the ESG & Reputational Risk Clearing process, particular importance is also given to the application of the Equator Principles, which are international guidelines, for all countries and all industrial sectors, applicable to the financing of infrastructure and industrial projects (e.g. power plants, petrochemical plants, mines, transport and telecommunications infrastructure) that due to their nature may have adverse effects on people and the environment."
