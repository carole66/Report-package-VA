"For other hazards and geographies, we source sensitivity estimations from Moody’s ESG Solutions, relying on projections to 2040."
"For physical risks ... exposure to hazards (such as flooding, heat stress and sea level rise)... For our portfolio located in the Netherlands, we source exposure to flooding from the Climate Impact Atlas of Climate Adaptation Services (CAS), relying on 2050 projections, as well as from Encore (Exploring natural capital opportunities risks and exposure). For other hazards and geographies ... sensitivity estimations from Moody’s ESG Solutions, relying on projections to 2040."
"For physical risks, sensitivity is based on a combination of sector characteristics, such as dependence on assets, labour and ecosystem services, as well as the regional and country-based exposure to hazards (such as flooding, heat stress and sea level rise). For our portfolio located in the Netherlands, we source exposure to flooding from the Climate Impact Atlas of Climate Adaptation Services (CAS), relying on 2050 projections, as well as from Encore (Exploring natural capital opportunities risks and exposure). For other hazards and geographies, we source sensitivity estimations from Moody’s ESG Solutions, relying on projections to 2040."
"Geographic physical risk data comes from: i) locations in the Netherlands collateralised by residential real estate, which contains information on flooding and wildfires from the Climate Impact Atlas (CIA) and information on foundation risks from the Kennis Centrum Aanpak Funderingsproblematiek; ii) other locations in the Netherlands, which includes flooding data from the CIA and information on wildfires, heat stress, water stress, hurricanes and typhoons and sea level rise from Moody's; iii) locations outside the Netherlands, which includes information on flooding, wildfires, heat stress, water stress, hurricanes and typhoons and sea level rise from Moody's."

"The starting point of the physical risk assessment is the climate hazard exposure to a counterparty’s geographical location or, when available, its collateral. The exposure is marked as sensitive to acute or chronic risk if the location is sensitive to one of the underlying hazards, as in Moody’s ESG Solutions methodology."
